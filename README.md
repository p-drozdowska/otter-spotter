# Otter Spotter
Otter Spotter is a simple game I made in Scratch as part of the CS50x course.

## How to play
[Click here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/411029406) to access the online version of the game.

Your job is to deliver the sea urchins (your cursor) to the sea otters, whilst avoiding lurking sea lions and the shark that follows you at an increasing speed. Golden sea otters will grant you extra points. Your score counter is in the top right.

## About this project
Harvard's CS50x uses Scratch, a block-based visual programming language to introduce basic programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditions and variables. As part of this introduction the students are instructed to build a simple program 'from scratch'. This was my first open-ended project of this kind, and I decided to test my abilities on a simple interactive game.
